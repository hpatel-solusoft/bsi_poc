    POST /graph/ingest — the AppWorks Lifecycle-event contract.

    Today this endpoint is called by hand (or by etl/run_sync.py, which
    calls the same service function directly). It is shaped for what
    AppWorks will send once the lifecycle event is wired up: the case that
    changed, and nothing else. Everything AppWorks would have to know to
    populate any other field is something the server can work out for
    itself, and every such field would be one more thing to keep in sync
    across two systems.

    case_ids  — one for a lifecycle event, many for a POC/demo backfill.
    run_rules — false loads structural data into Neo4j without reasoning
                over it. Useful when staging a large backfill and running
                the rules as a separate step; never the default, because a
                loaded-but-unreasoned graph looks complete and is not.
    subjects  — "primary" mirrors what an investigator opening the case
                triggers (Section 5.2's scope). "all" is the demo preload:
                every subject on the case gets a completed pipeline run, so
                any test subject can be opened cold and already have one.
